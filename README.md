# Next-JS
Lets' EXPOUND this MODERN framework.

## What is Next.js?
Next.js is an open-source JavaScript framework that is built on top of React a popular JavaScript library for building user interfaces.
It is designed to make it easier to create server-rendered React applications with a focus on developer productivity, performance and SEO(Search Engine Optimization). Next.js provides a set of tools and convections that simplify various aspects of building web applications.

## Features
1. Server-side rendering(SSR): Next.js allows you to render React components on the server side before sending them to the client. This can improve page load times and SEO.

2. Static site generation (SSG): Next.js also supports static site generation, where you can pre-render pages at build time. This approach is great for content-heavy and can offer even better performance and SEO benefits.

3. API routes: It offers a built-in API route features that allows you to create serverless API endpoints within your Next.js project, making it easy to handle backend logic.

## Routing
Routing is like giving directions to a website when you type a web address(URL) into your browser, routing tells the website which page or thing to show you. It's like a map that guides the website to the right place when you click a link or enter a web address. So, routing helps the website know what to display based on what you're looking for.

## Link
1. Link is a component provided by Next.js that allows you to create links to navigate between pages in your application.

2. It's primarily used for declarative, client-side navigation. When you click on a link created with Link, it prevents the default browser full-page refresh and fetches the new page content on the client side, resulting in a faster and smoother user experience.

3. It's typically used in your component's JSX code to create clickable links that lead to other pages within your Next.js application.

## useRouter()
1. useRouter is a hook provided by Next.js that allows you to access the router object and its properties within your component.

2. It provides programmatic control over the router and allows you to navigate to different pages or perform other routing-related actions in response to user interactions or events within your component.

3. It's useful when you need to handle navigation or access route-specific information directly in your component logic.
