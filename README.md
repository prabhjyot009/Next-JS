# Next-JS
Lets' EXPOUND this MODERN framework.

## What is Next.js?
Next.js is an open-source JavaScript framework that is built on top of React a popular JavaScript library for building user interfaces.
It is designed to make it easier to create server-rendered React applications with a focus on developer productivity, performance and SEO(Search Engine Optimization). Next.js provides a set of tools and convections that simplify various aspects of building web applications.

## Features
1. Server-side rendering(SSR): Next.js allows you to render React components on the server side before sending them to the client. This can improve page load times and SEO.

2. Static site generation (SSG): Next.js also supports static site generation, where you can pre-render pages at build time. This approach is great for content-heavy and can offer even better performance and SEO benefits.

3. API routes: It offers a built-in API route features that allows you to create serverless API endpoints within your Next.js project, making it easy to handle backend logic.

## Routing
Routing is like giving directions to a website when you type a web address(URL) into your browser, routing tells the website which page or thing to show you. It's like a map that guides the website to the right place when you click a link or enter a web address. So, routing helps the website know what to display based on what you're looking for.

## Link
1. Link is a component provided by Next.js that allows you to create links to navigate between pages in your application.

2. It's primarily used for declarative, client-side navigation. When you click on a link created with Link, it prevents the default browser full-page refresh and fetches the new page content on the client side, resulting in a faster and smoother user experience.

3. It's typically used in your component's JSX code to create clickable links that lead to other pages within your Next.js application.
